# FaceID-using-MTCNN-FaceNet
A real-time FaceID model using OpenCV, MTCNN, FaceNet and SVM

1. Run cv.py for creating a database by capturing user face features.
2. Run traindata.py to train and export the model as a pickle file.
3. run fclassification to capture frames real-time to detect known facial features and predict the user.
